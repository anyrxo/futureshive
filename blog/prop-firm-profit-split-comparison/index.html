For example, on a $50K account earning $30K, you keep all of the first $25K + 90% of the remaining $5K ($4,500) = $29,500 total (98.3% effective split). TopStep is second with 100% of first $10K then 90%, while FundedNext offers up to 95% for CFDs and 100% for futures. For forex traders, FundedNext's 95% split or FTMO's 90% (with scaling) are competitive options."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "A prop firm profit split is the percentage of trading profits you keep versus what the prop firm takes. The industry standard is 80-20 (you keep 80%, firm takes 20%), though top firms now offer 90-95% or even 100% structures. For example, if you earn $5,000 in a month: 80% split = you keep $4,000, firm takes $1,000; 90% split = you keep $4,500, firm takes $500; 100% split = you keep all $5,000. The split compensates the firm for providing capital, platform, risk management, and support. Better profit splits directly increase your take-home earnings - a 90% split earns you $500 more per $5K profit compared to 80%."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Not necessarily. Higher profit splits increase earnings only if other factors are equal. Consider: (1) Payout frequency - a 90% split paid monthly ties up capital longer than 80% paid bi-weekly; (2) Trading costs - firms with 90% splits but 1.5 pip spreads may cost more than 80% split firms with 0.8 pip spreads due to per-trade costs adding up; (3) Account sizes - an 80% split on a $100K account ($4,000 on $5K profit) beats a 95% split on a $10K account ($475 on $500 profit); (4) Scaling opportunities - FTMO's 80% (scaling to $400K) can outperform a 95% split capped at $50K long-term; (5) Monthly fees - recurring fees ($150-$400/month) reduce effective profit split. Calculate total monthly earnings after all costs, not just the advertised split percentage."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Apex and TopStep both offer 100% initial profit structures but differ significantly: Apex: 100% of first $25,000, then 90%; TopStep: 100% of first $10,000, then 90%. For $30K in total profits: Apex = $25K (100%) + $4.5K (90% of $5K) = $29,500 kept (98.3% effective); TopStep = $10K (100%) + $18K (90% of $20K) = $28,000 kept (93.3% effective). Apex advantage: $1,500 more earnings on $30K profit. However, TopStep has lower monthly costs ($165 vs $147-$377 for Apex), no evaluation fee (monthly subscription model), and a strong 15+ year reputation. Apex suits traders targeting $20K-$50K profits monthly; TopStep suits consistent $5K-$15K monthly earners who value the subscription model and institutional backing."

          "@type": "Question",
          "name": "Can I negotiate a higher profit split with a prop firm?",
          "acceptedAnswer": {
            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Generally no, but there are pathways to increase your split: (1) Scaling programs - FTMO increases from 80% to 90% when you scale beyond certain thresholds; FundedNext, Apex, and others maintain or improve splits as you scale; (2) Add-on purchases - some firms like Goat Funded Trader, DNA Funded, and FundedNext offer 90-100% profit split upgrades for an additional fee ($50-$200) at purchase; (3) Elite trader programs - after proving consistent profitability (6-12 months), some firms offer custom terms to top performers, including better splits, but this is rare and not advertised; (4) Multiple accounts - combining accounts (e.g., two $50K accounts) doesn't change the per-account split but doubles total earnings capacity. The best strategy is choosing a firm with your desired split upfront rather than hoping to negotiate later. Established firms rarely negotiate individual splits as it creates fairness issues across their trader base."

        <div class="blog-content">
            <p><strong>Your profit split determines how much money you actually keep from your trading.</strong> While most prop firms advertise their splits prominently (80%, 90%, 100%), understanding the nuances - like "100% of first $25K" structures, scaling improvements, and hidden costs - is critical for maximizing earnings. This guide breaks down every major prop firm's profit split with real earnings calculations.</p>

                <h3>Quick Answer: Top 3 Profit Splits</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Apex Trader Funding</strong> - 100% first $25K, then 90% (best overall for futures)</li>
                    <li><strong>TopStep</strong> - 100% first $10K, then 90% (best for consistent traders)</li>
                    <li><strong>FundedNext</strong> - Up to 95% for CFDs, 100% for futures (best for forex)</li>
                </ol>

            <h2>What Is a Prop Firm Profit Split?</h2>

            <p>A <strong>profit split</strong> (also called profit share) is the percentage of your trading profits you keep versus what the prop firm takes. It's the most important factor determining your take-home earnings.</p>

            <p><strong>Example:</strong> You earn $5,000 in trading profits on a funded account.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>80% split:</strong> You keep $4,000, firm takes $1,000</li>
                <li><strong>90% split:</strong> You keep $4,500, firm takes $500</li>
                <li><strong>100% split:</strong> You keep all $5,000, firm takes $0</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The split compensates the prop firm for providing trading capital, platforms, risk management systems, customer support, and absorbing losses when traders breach accounts. Higher splits mean more money in your pocket.</p>

            <h3>Industry Standard: 80-20 Split</h3>

            <p>The traditional prop trading industry standard is an <strong>80-20 split</strong> (trader keeps 80%, firm takes 20%). Most budget and mid-tier firms offer this as their standard rate:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>FTMO: 80% (upgradeable to 90%)</li>
                <li>FundedNext: 80% standard (add-ons for 90-95%)</li>
                <li>Most budget firms: 80% standard</li>
                <li>The Funded Trader: 80-90%</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Never accept less than 70%.</strong> Any firm offering 60% or 50% splits (unless you're at The 5%ers entry level) is taking too much of your hard-earned profits.</p>

            <h2>100% Profit Split Firms: Apex vs TopStep</h2>

            <p>Two firms stand out with <strong>100% profit split structures</strong> on your initial earnings: Apex Trader Funding and TopStep. But they work very differently.</p>

                    <li>You earn another $20K (now $30K total) → You keep all of first $25K + 90% of remaining $5K = $25,000 + $4,500 = <strong>$29,500 total</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Effective split on $30K profit: 98.3%</strong></li>

            <h2>90-95% Profit Split Firms</h2>

            <p>Several firms offer 90-95% splits without the 100% initial threshold structure. These are excellent for forex traders and those wanting high splits from day one.</p>

            <div class="split-card">
                <h3>

                </h3>

                <p><strong>Standard Split:</strong> 80% (upgradeable to 90-95% with add-ons)</p>
                <p><strong>Special Feature:</strong> 15% profit sharing during evaluation phase (reduces your risk)</p>
                <p><strong>Futures Split:</strong> Up to 100% for futures contracts</p>

                <p><strong>Why It's Special:</strong> FundedNext is the only major firm offering profit sharing during the evaluation. If you earn $1,000 during your Phase 1 challenge, you receive $150 (15%) even if you eventually fail. This reduces evaluation risk significantly.</p>

            <h2>Does a Higher Profit Split Always Mean More Earnings?</h2>

            <p>Not necessarily. The profit split is only one factor in total earnings. Here's what else matters:</p>

            <h3>1. Trading Costs (Spreads and Commissions)</h3>

            <p>Wide spreads can erase the benefit of a higher profit split for active traders.</p>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>⚠️ Example: 95% Split with Wide Spreads vs 80% Split with Tight Spreads</h4>
                <p><strong>Firm A:</strong> 95% split, 1.5 pip EUR/USD spread</p>
                <p><strong>Firm B:</strong> 80% split, 0.8 pip EUR/USD spread</p>
                <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> You trade 100 lots of EUR/USD, earning $10,000 gross profit</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Firm A:</strong> $10,000 profit - $150 spread costs (1.5 pips × 100 lots) = $9,850 × 95% = <strong>$9,357 to you</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Firm B:</strong> $10,000 profit - $80 spread costs (0.8 pips × 100 lots) = $9,920 × 80% = <strong>$7,936 to you</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Winner:</strong> Firm A by $1,421, but only because the profit was large. For smaller profits or more trades, tight spreads can outweigh higher splits.</p>
            </div>

            <p><strong>Rule of Thumb:</strong> Scalpers and high-frequency traders should prioritize spreads; swing traders should prioritize profit splits.</p>

            <h3>2. Payout Frequency</h3>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>On-demand/Immediate:</strong> Apex, Take Profit Trader - access profits anytime</li>
                <li><strong>Bi-weekly:</strong> FTMO, FundedNext, TopStep - reliable but ties up capital for 14 days</li>
                <li><strong>Monthly:</strong> Some budget firms - significant capital lockup</li>
            </ul>

            <p>A 90% split paid monthly means your capital is tied up 4 weeks. An 85% split paid bi-weekly gives you faster capital rotation for reinvestment or personal use.</p>

            <h3>3. Account Sizes and Scaling</h3>

            <p>An 80% split on a $100K account ($4,000 on $5K profit) beats a 95% split on a $10K account ($475 on $500 profit). Always consider how large you can scale.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>FTMO:</strong> 80-90% split, scales to $400K = $18K-$36K on $40K monthly profit</li>
                <li><strong>Maven Trading:</strong> 80% split, caps at ~$100K = $4K on $5K monthly profit</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4. Monthly Fees and Ongoing Costs</h3>

            <p>Apex and TopStep charge recurring monthly fees ($150-$377), which reduce effective earnings:</p>

            <div class="earnings-example">
                <h4>Effective Split Calculation with Monthly Fees</h4>
                <p><strong>Apex:</strong> $10K profit, 100% split, $150 monthly fee = $9,850 net = <strong>98.5% effective split</strong></p>
                <p><strong>FTMO:</strong> $10K profit, 80% split, no monthly fee = $8,000 net = <strong>80% effective split</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Break-even point:</strong> Apex becomes more profitable when monthly profits exceed ~$800</p>
            </div>

            <h2>How to Choose the Right Profit Split for You</h2>

            <p>Select your profit split based on your trading profile:</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h3>Choose 100% First-Profit Structures (Apex, TopStep) If:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>You consistently earn $10K-$50K+ monthly</li>
                    <li>You trade futures (ES, NQ, micros)</li>
                    <li>You want maximum earnings on your best months</li>
                    <li>You're comfortable with monthly recurring fees</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h3>Choose 90-95% Straight Splits (FundedNext, FTMO 90%) If:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>You trade forex and need high splits without futures focus</li>
                    <li>You want simplicity (no hybrid split calculations)</li>
                    <li>You value fast payouts (FundedNext's 24 hours)</li>
                    <li>You want evaluation profit sharing (FundedNext's 15%)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h3>Choose 80% Standard Splits (FTMO, Budget Firms) If:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>You prioritize scaling to $400K+ (FTMO's 80→90% path)</li>
                    <li>You value tight spreads and low trading costs</li>
                    <li>You want the lowest evaluation entry cost (budget firms)</li>
                    <li>You're starting your prop trading journey</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>Can You Negotiate Profit Splits?</h2>

            <p>Generally, no. Established prop firms have standardized splits to maintain fairness across their trader base. However, there are pathways to increase your split:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Scaling Programs:</strong> FTMO, FundedNext, and others increase splits when you scale accounts</li>
                <li><strong>Add-On Purchases:</strong> Goat Funded Trader, DNA Funded, and FundedNext offer 90-100% upgrades for $50-$200 extra at purchase</li>
                <li><strong>Elite Trader Programs:</strong> After 6-12 months of exceptional performance, some firms offer custom terms to top performers (rare and not advertised)</li>
                <li><strong>Multiple Accounts:</strong> Combining accounts doesn't change per-account splits but doubles earning capacity</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="tip-box">
                <h4>💡 Pro Tip: Focus on Total Earnings, Not Just Split Percentage</h4>
                <p>A 95% split on a $10K account earning $500/month = $475 to you. An 80% split on a $100K account earning $5K/month = $4,000 to you. <strong>The second scenario earns you 8.4x more despite a 15% lower split.</strong> Prioritize firms offering strong scaling paths over those with the highest advertised splits.</p>

                <p>100% of first $25K then 90% creates the highest take-home for traders earning $20K-$50K+ monthly. The $150-$377 monthly fee is easily justified at these profit levels.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h3>Best Balance of Split and Reputation: TopStep</h3>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h3>Best for Forex Traders: FundedNext</h3>
                <p>Up to 95% split, 24-hour payouts, 15% profit sharing during evaluations, and $147M track record. Excellent for forex traders who can't use futures-focused firms.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h3>Best Long-Term Scaling: FTMO</h3>
                <p>80% improving to 90% with scaling to $400K creates massive long-term earning potential. A $400K account at 90% split earning 5% monthly = $18,000 to you per month ($216K annually).</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Which prop firm has the best profit split?</h3>
                    <p>Apex Trader Funding offers the best overall profit split structure: <strong>100% of the first $25,000 in profits, then 90% thereafter.</strong> For example, on a $50K account earning $30K, you keep all of the first $25K + 90% of the remaining $5K ($4,500) = $29,500 total (98.3% effective split). TopStep is second with 100% of first $10K then 90%, while FundedNext offers up to 95% for CFDs and 100% for futures. For forex traders, FundedNext's 95% split or FTMO's 90% (after scaling) are the most competitive options available.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What is a prop firm profit split?</h3>
                    <p>A prop firm profit split is the percentage of trading profits you keep versus what the prop firm takes. The industry standard is 80-20 (you keep 80%, firm takes 20%), though top firms now offer 90-95% or even 100% structures. For example, if you earn $5,000 in a month: <strong>80% split</strong> = you keep $4,000, firm takes $1,000; <strong>90% split</strong> = you keep $4,500, firm takes $500; <strong>100% split</strong> = you keep all $5,000. The split compensates the firm for providing capital, platform access, risk management infrastructure, and support while absorbing losses when traders breach accounts. Better profit splits directly increase your take-home earnings - a 90% split earns you $500 more per $5K profit compared to 80%, which compounds to $6,000 extra annually on consistent $5K monthly profits.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Does a higher profit split always mean more earnings?</h3>
                    <p>Not necessarily. Higher profit splits increase earnings only if other factors are equal. Consider these critical factors: <strong>(1) Payout frequency</strong> - a 90% split paid monthly ties up your capital longer than an 80% split paid bi-weekly, affecting reinvestment opportunities; <strong>(2) Trading costs</strong> - firms with 90% splits but 1.5 pip spreads may cost more than 80% split firms with 0.8 pip spreads, as per-trade costs add up quickly for active traders; <strong>(3) Account sizes</strong> - an 80% split on a $100K account ($4,000 on $5K profit) beats a 95% split on a $10K account ($475 on $500 profit) by a factor of 8.4x; <strong>(4) Scaling opportunities</strong> - FTMO's 80% split scaling to $400K accounts can outperform a 95% split capped at $50K in long-term earnings; <strong>(5) Monthly fees</strong> - recurring subscription fees ($150-$400/month) effectively reduce your profit split percentage. Always calculate total monthly earnings after all costs including spreads, commissions, and fees rather than just comparing advertised split percentages.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How do Apex and TopStep profit splits compare?</h3>
                    <p>Apex and TopStep both offer 100% initial profit structures but differ significantly in implementation and results: <strong>Apex:</strong> 100% of first $25,000, then 90%; <strong>TopStep:</strong> 100% of first $10,000, then 90%. For $30K in total profits: <strong>Apex</strong> = $25K (100%) + $4.5K (90% of $5K) = $29,500 kept (98.3% effective split); <strong>TopStep</strong> = $10K (100%) + $18K (90% of $20K) = $28,000 kept (93.3% effective split). <strong>Apex advantage:</strong> $1,500 more earnings on $30K profit, which scales proportionally with higher earnings. However, TopStep has lower monthly costs ($165 vs $147-$377 for Apex), no separate evaluation fee (subscription model covers everything), and a stronger 15+ year reputation with $200M+ in verified payouts. <strong>Best choice:</strong> Apex suits aggressive traders targeting $20K-$50K+ monthly profits who want maximum splits; TopStep suits consistent $5K-$15K monthly earners who value institutional backing and lower base costs.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can I negotiate a higher profit split with a prop firm?</h3>
                    <p>Generally no, established prop firms maintain standardized splits to ensure fairness across their trader base. However, there are legitimate pathways to increase your profit split: <strong>(1) Scaling programs</strong> - FTMO automatically increases from 80% to 90% when you scale beyond certain account sizes and time thresholds; FundedNext, Apex, and others maintain or improve splits as you progress; <strong>(2) Add-on purchases</strong> - firms like Goat Funded Trader, DNA Funded, and FundedNext offer 90-100% profit split upgrades for an additional fee ($50-$200) at initial purchase; <strong>(3) Elite trader programs</strong> - after proving consistent profitability for 6-12 months, some firms extend custom terms to top performers including better splits, but this is rare and not publicly advertised; <strong>(4) Multiple accounts</strong> - combining multiple funded accounts doesn't change the per-account split but effectively doubles or triples your total earning capacity. <strong>Best strategy:</strong> Choose a firm offering your desired split structure upfront rather than hoping to negotiate later, as individual negotiations create fairness issues and are rarely granted by reputable firms.</p>
